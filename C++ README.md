# Overview

In this program I go over a number of basic topics that you would need to know in oprder to program in C++. These topics include variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, vectors, and how to read and write files. It will show you how t o use each and what are some of the ways that you can display these different topics to the user.

My purpose in writing this program is to not only show my understanding of C++ but also to help those who are new to C++ get a basic understanding of how it works and some of the syntax and topics that will be standard in almost any program that they will create.
